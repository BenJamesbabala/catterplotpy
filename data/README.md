These data files are derived from the R catterplot:
https://github.com/Gibbsdavidl/CatterPlots. The data file ``cats.rda`` is
copied from there, and the ``reprocess_cats.py`` script converts them into
numpy array format.  This data file is included here so as not to require the
user running the script, but it is retained in case ``cats.rda`` is updated
in the future.
