All you should need to do is install via ``python setup.py install`` and then:
```python
from catterplot import catter
catter(x, y, ...)
```
See the `catterplot` docstring for all the available options.

This work was inspired in large part by
[David L Gibbs' R catterplot](https://github.com/Gibbsdavidl/CatterPlots). The
cat shapes are directly derived from that work.
